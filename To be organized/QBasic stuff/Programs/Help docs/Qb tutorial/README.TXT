    WEB: http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/campus/9647
    Made in Euskadi.

    First of all I want to say that I'm BASQUE and that my english is not
    very good. So don't mind about the mistakes I've done. 

Introduction
============

        This is a recompilatory of diferent tutorials that I have found on the
net. I made the QBME.EXE program with Qbasic (of course), and that's all.

        This is not a hard work for me, becouse the only thing that I have
done is to copy the tutorials that I think that are interesting. I haven't
contac the authors, but i think that there is not problem with the copyrigths
and I think that the thing what I've do is complity legal.  If there is any
problem with it or someone is worry, please tell me.

        The only pourpose of this program is to show the tutorials that the
people have done, so you can do with this what you want. The only thing I
will thank it will be some feedback.

        This is the first time I make a text based program on Qbasic and
I have to say that I'm very happy with the resoult.

        From this lines I want to thank the people who have write those
tutorials and all the tutorials that had help me learning to programing and
another things.


Contents
========

        This articles have advanted QB stuff, so if you are a beginer you'll
have problems to understand them. So be patient and before read this, you
must lear the BASIC basics.


Files
=====
  Those are the files that you must have.        

    QBME.EXE => The main program to read the tutorials and articles.

    *.FNT    => Fonts used by the program.

    *.TXT    => The tutorials and articles.

    *.BAS    => The examples.

       Total 43 files.


Keys and how to use them
========================

        I think that is realy easy to use this program, look at the keys:

                ARROWS up or down to move in the menus.
                       This key is also used to move the text.

                ESC    Go back (if someone is realy desorientated!! he he!)

                PAGE-UP  
                PAGE-DOWN  Those keys are also used to move the text.

                RETURN  To select.

        And that's all.


Your Help
=========

        For the future I want to do a most extensive and more ordenated
recopilatory, this is why I ask for your help. So if you have interesting
material or you could write good articles or tutorials please send them to me
to h20ur@yahoo.com.

        I'm specialy interested in SB programing, Modem programing, printer
programing... But I will take any article or tutorial that send me happily.

        So remenber that I'm waiting for your help.


Distribution
============

        As the program and all this is free, you can do with it what you want
exept change the files or any other modification. The only pourposit of this
package is to give information about Qbasic programing techniques. So don't
try to sell it, because I will k$&!" you. And of course don't pay to anyone
for this.

        Please distribute this package as long as you can, and if you are the
owner of a WEB page include this package.


Disclaimer
==========

        If this program crashes your PC (not posible!! he he), is not  my
problem. You are using this program at your own risk.

        
Compatibility
=============

        I think that the main program works in most of PCs, but I haven't test
it, so if you see that there is any problem please tell me.
