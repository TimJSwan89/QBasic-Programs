
Segments and Offsets

So here's how segments and offsets work.

U have 2 things, a segment, and an offset.  Each is 16 bits in size, that
means it can hold a value from 0-65535.  Back in the heyday of the
Commodore 64, (which had 64k of RAM), a single 16 bit address could put
you anywhere in memory.  But with the 8086 which had 1 meg, you could't
do that with 16 bits!  'An the engineers didn't wanna do it with 32 bits,
'cuz that would waste space.  So they decided to invent a curse called
segments and offsets.  The CURSE goes like this:

In order to calculate an actual address, multiply the segment by 16 and
add the offset.

address = segment * 16 + offset

And with that scheme, programmers could access 1 meg!  Whoopie eh?

There I explained it.  Sorry about my mood and writing style today.
And who was it that didn't like my base 3 tutorial?  Huh???
