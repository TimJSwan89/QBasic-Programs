
Waiting For the Verticle Retrace
-HAL_8900 
 
	I know every single person out there has at one time 
download some QB-Game that has TERRIBLE flicker. This is 
caused by the program running too fast for the monitor to keep 
up... 
there's one simple way to eliminate this problem..... wait for the 
verticle retrace on the monitor! 
	 
	Now, before everyone goes "Ungh? WAIT? I want my 
program to be FAST!" you need to understand, WAITing for the 
verticle retrace doesn't slow down the program all that much (after 
all, it's a hardware thing) and the delay will be imperceptable 
(sp?). Also, you can add this without having to rewrite your entire 
program.... here's and example: 
 
SUB ANIMATE 
DO 
WAIT &H3DA, 8 
PUT (x,y), sprite<----Assuming that sprite has already been 
BLOADED and GET-ed(GET-ed ehehe) 
x=x+1 
LOOP 
 
Now, of course, with this program, you'll have a long line of sprites 
when you run it, but  
implement the command 
WAIT &H3DA, 8  
on any animation thats flickery and it should stop (or reduce) the 
flicker.... 
Now, this wont ALWAYS work... 
On really fast machines, this algorithm will work sometimes, at 
best, but on 486's and Lower-End (66mhz-120 mhz) pentiums, this 
will produce fantastic results! 
 
YUP! THATS IT!!!!!
