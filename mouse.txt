  1. Reset the mouse to it's default position

    Regs.AX = 0
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)

  2. Show the mouse

    Regs.AX = 1
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)

  3. Hide the mouse

    Regs.AX = 2
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)
        
  4. Get the status of the mouse

    Regs.AX = 3
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)

    leftMouseButton = Regs.BX AND 1             'These values are
    rightMouseButton = (Regs.BX AND 2) \ 2      'placed in Regs by BIOS
    middleMouseButton = (Regs.BX AND 4) \ 4     'when you perform the
    xPosition = Regs.DX                         'call.
    yPosition = Regs.CX

  5. Move the mouse to a new place on the screen

    Regs.AX = 4
    Regs.CX = newYPosition
    Regs.DX = newXPosition
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)

  6. Define a range on the screen that the mouse 'lives' in

    Regs.AX = 7
    Regs.CX = minimumXValue
    Regs.DX = maximumXValue
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)

    Regs.AX = 8
    Regs.CX = minimumYValue
    Regs.DX = maximumYValue
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)

  7. Set the sensitivity of the mouse (how fast it moves)

    Regs.AX = 15
    Regs.CX = xSpeed                'Mouse moves faster as these values
    Regs.DX = ySpeed                'are decreased.
    CALL INTERRUPT(&H33, Regs, Regs)
